## Air Express
* **Category:** Cooperation
* **Activity:** This is a high-energy activity about producing results. Two teams can work this activity from opposite ends of a volleyball court. The starting boundary is 30' feet from the net. At the start are three beach balls. On the other side of the net are three inner tubes. The team must get the balls over the net and onto the inner tubes in the quickest time they can, without carrying the balls in transit, or touching the net. They are aiming for the quickest time possible. In order to be able to claim a time as legitimate, however, they must be able to predict the time, then meet or beat the time twice in succession. The teams can either collaborate or cooperate in the process, or find a mix that meets everyone's needs, and produces the best result. (This activity generates enthusiasm and creativity from everyone involved.)
* **Age:** N/A
* **Area Needed:** Open area
* **Equipment/Materials:** 3 beach balls, a net or rope that could be hung up, 3 inner tubes

## Airplane Chair
* **Category:** fun, trust
* **Activity:** Blindfold a participant and have him/her sit in a chair.  Begin to tell the story of them flying off to some awesome location.  Have other participants help you lift the chair up off the ground (about 1 foot).  Then angle the chair to mimic an airplane turning.  Tell an exciting story and all the things s/he can see below.  Then the plane hits turbulence (shake the chair).  Finally, the plane crashes, and the chair is tilted forward, forcing the participant to fall out.  Generally, they land right on their feet, but a soft landing is preferred.  Participants feel like they are being lifted really high.  It creates quite a sensation.  Make sure everyone is quiet so the flyer can really feel like s/he is in the airplane.

## Alaskan Baseball
* **Category:** Cooperation
* **Activity:** Split the group into two teams.  Need at least 10 players.  One team throws the ball as far away as possible.  The second team chases after the ball.  Once team two gets the ball, they form a line and pass the ball to the person behind by alternating over the head and then under the legs.  Once the ball reaches the end of the line, they throw it as far away as possible while yelling stop to team one.  During that time, team one formed a circle and had one teammate run around the circle as many times as possible before team two yelled stop.  Once they hear stop, they chase after the ball and do what team two did, while team two has one player run around the group.  They count laps as they go.  There is the same number of innings as players on a team so that every teammate should run around the group once and throw the ball once.

## All Aboard
* **Category:** Problem Solving, Cooperation, Portable
* **Activity:** All group members get on top of a flat tarp.  You tell a story about how they are flying through outer space and land on a new planet, so they all get off.  Suddenly they are being attacked by aliens and they retreat to their ship, but it’s shrunk due to the metal eating algae.  So the tarp is now folded in half and everyone must get on so that no one’s foot is touching the ground.  They reach safety finally and all get to rest at what looks to be paradise.  However, a huge storm is approaching so they retreat to the ship again.  Again, the ship has shrunk and they must fit on again.  You continue this until it no longer seems that the group will be able to succeed.  This is a good way to develop comfort with touching.

* **Activity:** Ask the group to stand in a circle. Ask for two volunteers, and designate one of them the President and the other the Bodyguard. The President and Bodyguard then stand in the middle of the circle. The people on the outside of the circle are all Assassins. • The Assassins’ goal is to hit/kill the President using the ball. The Bodyguard’s goal is to protect the President by blocking the ball from hitting the President. • If the Bodyguard somehow gains control of the ball, the bodyguard can kill Assassins by hitting them with the ball. The Bodyguard can’t be killed. • The Assassins throw the ball to each other (fast and focused is most successful) and try to get the ball to an Assassin who can successfully hit and kill the President. Player cannot move their feet when they have the ball. The Assassins should try to remain in a circle formation during the game. • Once the President is killed, the Bodyguard becomes President, and the successful Assassin becomes the Bodyguard. • Be careful that no one gets hurt. DISCUSSION: • What techniques worked best for Assassins? Bodyguard and President? Was communication important? What role did teamwork play in success? • What did it feel like to be in the center? What did it feel like for the President to be dependent on one person for protection? • What happened when (if) Assassins or those in center lost focus? This could also be used in activism workshops to demonstrate the power of many people acting with a common goal (Assassins) or how one person can make aD difference (Bodyguard).

## Chicken Baseball
* **Category:** Fun, ice breaker
* **Activity:** First, divide the group into smaller teams of 5-10. Tell the group we are going to play some Chicken or Pig baseball. The team that starts with the Chicken, (Rock Paper Scissors to decide) will yell out “Chicken!” and throw the chicken. When they do, that team will form a circle and one team member will run around that circle gaining a point for each time they go around. Groups are told to tally and keep track of their own points and that we are trying to get the most points. The other (potentially opposing team) will run to where the chicken was thrown and form a line with one team member in front of the other. In order to stop the other (potentially opposing team) from scoring points this team must pass the chicken down the line by passing it over the first person’s head then under (or though) the legs of the next. It can be helpful for the facilitator to call out Over! Under! Over! Under! To remind them of what they must do and encourage them to be as quick as they can doing it. Once the chicken makes it to the last person, that person yells out “Chicken!” and throws the chicken. The team that was scoring points runs for the chicken and play continues for a few rounds or everyone is tired. Generally, the groups will throw the chicken as far from the other team as possible. A way to elevate this activity is to ask how many points each team has then combine the scores. Do the players change their behavior? Do they continue to throw the chicken away from or towards the other team?

The rules are fairly simple, each partnership must-touch the spot in the center without touching anyone else and each partner must end up where their partner began. This is a timed activity. Allow for multiple rounds to get the bestest, fastest time! It may be helpful to walk the group through the problem solving steps: ABCDE - Ask questions, Brainstorm, Choose a Plan and Check in with the group, Do It, Evaluate. Eventually someone will ask if they have to start in their initial positions, and of course they do not.

## Electric Maze
* **Category:** Problem solving, Cooperation, Portable
* **Activity:** The Maze activity is conducted on an electronic checkerboard patterned carpet and involves one or two teams. Starting at one end, each team needs to figure out the one path across the maze so that each person can cross without setting off an alarm. The carpet has weight sensors that are programmed to sound if one steps on an "off-limits" square. Teams set their own time and performance goals. Performance goals are measured by minimizing repeated hits on alarmed squares. Each subsequent alarm from an identified square has an incremental cost, measured in chips the team budgets for itself at the outset. If these chips are depleted, the facilitator/banker advances a team up to ten red (debt) chips, and after these, up to ten blue (equity) chips. The best collaboration effort between teams resulted in "0" cost - a perfect outcome.

## Get Off the Bus
* **Category:** Commonalities and Diversity
* **Activity:** Announce that the group is going to be on a bus and have them arrange themselves behind the “driver” (facilitator) as if they are on a school bus. Tell them that they will need to get off at every stop, but this bus has two sides, so they must get off on the appropriate side. Pretend to drive and then when you get to your first “stop” read aloud a statement and show the students which side they should get off on. For example you may read, “chocolate or vanilla” and then you will indicate which side people who prefer chocolate should stand on, and which side people who prefer vanilla should stand on. Give students a moment to acknowledge where they are in relation to each other and then invite them back on the bus and continue. Make about 10 stops with the group and then lead a short debrief about diversity and how you discover it or rely on it within a group.

## Helium Hoop
* **Category:** Communication, Cooperation
* **Activity:** the group gets in a line (pole) or circle (hula-hoop).  You explain that once you let go of the pole or hula-hoop, it’ll fly away because it’s filled with helium.  The entire group positions a finger underneath the object so it’s resting on the nail (this prevents participants from wrapping fingers around the object).  The group’s goal is to bring the object to the ground withoutanyone’s finger losing contact with the object.  Once you let go, the object usually flies up out of control.  Eventually a leader emerges to coordinate the group.  You must watch carefully to see whose finger loses contact because participants are usually not very honest, especially once they get frustrated. Each time a group member loses contact, the game starts from the beginning.  Discussions can be about leadership, honesty, frustration, expectations, and many other topics.

## Hot Stuff
* **Category:** Leadership, Problem solving
* **Activity:** A "nuclear reactor" is represented by a circle on the ground, about twelve feet in diameter. In the center is the "reactor core" with some "fuel" lying on top. A "containment device" is located off to the side. Outside the reactor, in the "control room," are materials available to the team. The team is informed it has about thirty minutes to contain the fuel (some balls) on the nuclear reactor core (a pedestal) to prevent a nuclear meltdown. No one can go into the reactor area, and must wear protective gear (blindfolds) if touching anything that does go into the reactor. This is a "hot" activity to demonstrate the need for clear roles and responsibilities, effective leadership, good communication, and shared problem solving to be successful. Teams can do this activity simultaneously and potentially help each other's problem solving. Or they can work in isolation and compare results later.

## Indiana Jones
* **Category:** fun, icebreaker, energizer
* **Activity:** Have the group form a circle. Every third person steps into the center of the circle then turns and faces the larger surrounding circle. The facilitator then walks the path made by the two circle and explains the game. I usually start by asking if anyone has seen Indiana Jones. I quickly describe the scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark where Indiana Jones is trying to preserve an ancient artifact but accidentally triggers a series of booby traps, the last of which, a giant boulder chases him out of the cave. I tell the group we are going to recreate that scene as a game here. Ask the group for a volunteer. This volunteer is Indiana Jones and will attempt to make it three times around the circle without being tagged by the ball. Although it is best to use a larger ball think beach ball or larger vs soccer ball it can be done with any sized ball. Play begins by first informing the group how the ball can travel. It may go forwards or backwards around the circle. I generally have the people forming the circle bend down with their hands outstretched to either side and we practice passing the ball around the circle. If the ball goes outside the circle play is paused until the ball is retrieved. Once Indiana is tagged ask for a new volunteer. I also generally have the person who starts with the ball be opposite of where Indiana starts.

## Jedi Knight (Finger Fencing)
* **Category:** Fun
* **Activity:** Pairs play this game.  There are two challenges: One requires the pairs to face each other with their palms up facing each other.  Each person is trying to make the other lose balance and move a foot.  This is done by slapping hands or faking it to throw off balance.  No other body part can be touched besides hands and tugging/grabbing is not allowed.  The other challenge has pairs grab each other’s right hand and point their index finger.  Like a lightsaber, they want to strike the other person in the leg with their pointer finger.  This game takes A LOT of space to move around and can get aggressive.

## Knee Tag
* **Category:** Fun
* **Activity:** 1. Start by asking for a volunteer. Participants pair up, facing each other, with feet stationary but knees free to move. 2. The goal is to tag an open knee of your partner while covering your own knees. Participants may switch hands covering their knees to entice their partner into tagging them. 3. Set up people into groups of two and begin the first round. After a few attempts, stop the group and introduce new rules: a. In the second round, participants are allowed to move one foot and pivot if desired. b. In the third round, participants can move freely and tag any open knee, not just their partner's. 4. Allow each round to continue for a brief period before introducing the next level of freedom. 5. Facilitate a discussion after the activity: - Ask participants about their experience with the different rounds and how the rules evolved. - Discuss the progression from fixed and rigid rules to more open and flexible ones. - Explore whether anyone broke the rules and what consequences, if any, were experienced. - Connect the activity to real-life scenarios where rules may have varying levels of flexibility and consequences.

## KPM (Kinetic People Movers) (Trolleys)
* **Category:** Cooperation, communication
* **Activity:** (Effective project hand-offs between teams) This activity can be done by one team, or with several teams working together. Participants are given a set of props that are identified as a trolley. The team needs to move the trolley along a route that goes to the end of the line and then returns to the station. The trolley operates to an exact timetable that the team sets before leaving the station. With multiple trolley teams, the challenge requires switching trolleys with another team at the end point, and returning the newly acquired trolley to its original station on the schedule set for it by the other team. The interaction produces inter-team dynamics common to hand-off efforts between teams, especially where "just-in-time" coordination is critical.

## Linking
* **Category:** Name Game, Icebreaker
* **Activity:** One person initiates the activity by saying their name and a variety of other information such as a fun fact about their family, things they are passionate about, something that is important to them, etc. After they have stated a few things they pause and wait for someone who shares one of the things that they said to link up with them either by holding hands, linking at elbows or even holding onto a length of rope (making a web as people keep joining in). The person who links must explain what the connection was, so if person 1 said “I am passionate about ice cream” person 2 may start in by saying, “I am Louisa and I worked at a creamery in high school, so I too am passionate about ice cream.” This person will then continue by stating other facts about themselves and allowing someone new to link with them. The activity continues until everyone is connected in a circle or web.

## Mafia Game
* **Category:** Fun, Collaboration
* **Activity:** This stationary game (originally invented by psychology student Dimitry Davidoff in Russia, 1986) is a popular group game involving strategy and bluffing. It is good for discussing topics such as lying, deception, trust, good versus evil, etc. or just for a fun time. There are five roles one can play: one narrator, two members of the mafia, two members of the police (or one the group is not large), one doctor, the remaining people are townspeople.
* **Age:** N/A
* **Area Needed:** N/A
* **Equipment/Materials:** deck of cards is helpful but not needed
* **Number of People:** 7+
* **Variations:** A variation for younger kids is known as Predator. Instead of mafia, there are “predators,” and instead of police there are “hunters.” Usually three separate predators (lion, wolf, bear) are chosen and they are instructed to pick up their heads separately and kill someone (they sometimes kill each other). Also, rather than using cards, simply just tap them while their heads are down (”If I tap you now, you are the bear.”) It makes it easier for the kids to keep it a secret.

## Mastermind
* **Category:** Problem Solving
* **Activity:** 1. The facilitator prepares four markers (poly spots, bandanas, or circles) and writes down four names correlating to these markers. 2. Participants must figure out, through the process of elimination and strategy, which name belongs to each marker. 3. The facilitator provides feedback to the group after each iteration, indicating how many names are correct and how many are in the correct position without specifying which ones. For example, the facilitator might say, "You have two names correct, and one is in the correct position," or "You have four names correct, but none are in the correct position." 4. Participants continue to make guesses and receive feedback until they correctly match all four names with their corresponding markers. 5. Optionally, the facilitator can front-load the activity with goal-setting questions, such as asking participants how many attempts they think they will need or how long they believe it will take to complete the task.
* **Age:** N/A
* **Area Needed:** N/A
* **Equipment/Materials:** Four poly spots, bandanas, or marked circles (if unavailable, draw circles in dirt)
* **Number of People:** 2 or more
* **Variations:** 1. Increase the difficulty by adding more names or markers. 2. Allow participants to write down their guesses instead of verbalizing them, adding an element of secrecy and strategy. 3. Use symbols, colors, or other categories instead of names for a different twist on the game.

## Maze
* **Category:** Cooperation, Problem Solving
* **Activity:** Write down a pattern on a piece of paper where the first number or image is in the bottom row of a grid of paper plates (grid size should be 5x5, 6x6, or bigger for advanced groups).  The pattern should be a sequence of plates that are either adjacent or diagonal from each other and never repeat.  The whole groups tries to get the pattern through trial and error.  One person goes at a time.  They step onto a plate and you tell them yes or no.  If they are correct, they take another step.  If s/he is still following the pattern, you say yes.  If you say no, then they leave and another person tries.  The game ends when one person successfully finishes the pattern.
* **Age:** N/A

* **Activity:** This is done with younger age groups but the older ones sometimes have a good laugh I always do. Attach string to one end of a room tie it at different places and heights to form a giant spider web. (Designing the web is often enjoyed the most) Depending how complex your web is you can blindfold and then they can instruct their mates through the web to the other side of the room. Or we play mission impossible theme tune dim the lights and have challenges to see who can get through to the other side of the room without touching the 'laser beams'.
* **Age:** N/A
* **Area Needed:** A space with trees or other things that you can tie yarn to in order to make a web.

## Monster
* **Category:** Cooperation, Fun
* **Activity:** Have a group travel from one spot to another.  The catch is that they are only allowed to have a certain number of hands and feet touching the ground at once, and the whole group must have contact with one another while traveling.  This could be run with two groups who could be separated by two lanes.  The number for feet and hands is best calculated by dividing the number of people in a group by 3.
* **Age:** N/A

## Mouse Traps
* **Category:** Trust
* **Activity:** Show the group how to carefully assemble a mousetrap. Have the group split up into pairs. Give each pair a mousetrap and a bandana (or they can just close their eyes). One person puts on the bandana while the other sets the mousetrap. Without touching the blind folded person, the setter tells the blindfolded person to slowly lower their hand over the mousetrap. When they have their hand on the mousetrap they will leave it there until the setter explains how to take it off without getting snapped (lift your hand up quickly). The setter must coach and offer encouragement throughout the activity, especially if the blindfolded person is really scared of the trap going off.

## Name Impulse
* **Category:** Ice Breakers
* **Activity:** 1. The facilitator gathers the participants and asks if everyone knows their own name. 2. Explain that the goal is to pass a "name impulse" around the circle as quickly as possible. 3. The person to the facilitator's left starts by saying their name aloud, then the person to their left says their own name, and this continues around the circle until the person to the facilitator's right says their name, at which point the facilitator stops the time. 4. Record the time taken to complete the impulse and share it with the group. 5. Encourage goal-setting by asking the group how fast they think they can pass the name impulse. 6. Conduct multiple rounds passing the impulse to the left. 7. After a few rounds, switch it up with a couple of rounds passing the impulse to the right. 8. Discuss with the group which direction was faster and reflect on the experience. Emphasize that everyone is part of the winning team.
* **Age:** N/A
* **Area Needed:** N/A
* **Equipment/Materials:** N/A
* **Number of People:** 5 or more
* **Variations:** 1. Introduce a penalty for mistakes, such as restarting the impulse if someone says the wrong name or hesitates. 2. Add complexity by passing the impulse in reverse order, starting from the facilitator's right. 3. For larger groups, divide into smaller circles and have multiple impulses going simultaneously.

## Name Roulette
* **Category:** Name Game
* **Activity:** Split group into two teams.  Have teams form into two separate circles.  One team member from each team should have a foot inside the circle.  On go, both teams start walking in a circle, one going clockwise, the other going counterclockwise.  Each team member should pass the hula-hoop and place one foot inside.  When the facilitator says stop, one team member from each group should have a foot inside the circle.  Those two compete to see who can yell out the other one’s name first.  The loser joins the other team.  Eventually one team should dwindle down and you can stop at any point.
