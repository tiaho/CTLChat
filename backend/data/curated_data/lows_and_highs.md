# LOW ELEMENTS AT HOFFMAN COURSE 
## Acid River
* **Objective:** Move the group from block to block across the acid river using three boards laid on the blocks.
* **Description:** N/A
* **Set Up:** Lay out two lengths of rope on both ends of the river. The group is then given three planks (8ft. in length), which they will use to cross the river of acid. The group will start from one end of the river behind the rope laid out. As the group begins they will find that the boards will not reach laying certain ways on the block, and may drop a board in the river. Once this happens they lose that board, and it is explained to them that the other two boards are acid proof (they only really need two boards; the third is a learning tool).
* **Rules:** N/A
* **Safety:**
    * Caution participants about the weight of the boards- they are heavy-especially when trying to place them at a distance
    * Remind participants not to pinch their fingers when placing boards
    * Remind participants to be careful in swinging boards so as not to hit another person
    * Spot as appropriate
    * Boards should not be placed diagonally from block to block- it just may reach in one or two places, but it is not fully on either block and therefore not meant to be used that way
    * Participants should not to jump from block to block
    * Some Boards are more flexible than others
* **Special Consideration:** N/A
* **Age:** Any
* **Number of People:** 6 minimum, 12 maximum unless there are 2 sets of boards (3 boards per set)
* **Suited for Professional Programs:** Yes
* **Complexity:** 4
* **Themes:**
    * Leaders emerge and group members begin to take on specific roles within the team
    * Activity creates a heightened awareness of group strengths
    * Problem solving
* **Variations:**
    * Could split the group in half and have both teams start at different ends of the river. For added challenge, increase the number of boards that are not acid proof, so that the two teams will have to cooperate and help one another cross the river.
    * If any group member touched the river they could lose use of a limb or their vision or speech.
    * Start with more or less board and create reasons to add or take away boards.

## Island Hop
* **Objective:** The entire group will start on one platform and move everyone to the other platform by using the three boards and the people in their group. This must be done without anybody or any of the boards touching the ground. Every person must visit at least 4 islands without touching the ground on their travels. One person must retrieve the elixir of life from the far island and bring it back to homebase.
* **Description:** There are 5 islands which vary in size and distance from one another.
* **Set Up:** N/A
* **Rules:**
    * Everyone starts at the home base and goes around to all four islands
    * You must get the elixir (glass of water) at the far island and return it to homebase
    * You can use two 4’ planks and two 8’ planks
    * If you step in in the ocean (off the islands) you must return to homebase
    * If a board touches the ocean (ground) you must return the board to home base
* **Safety:**
    * If you feel yourself falling, please be safe and calmly step down.
    * Be aware of fingers and toes and other people around you, so as not to bump any digits or people while placing the boards on the platforms.
    * If the boards are used as a plank to walk on, the bottom, weight bearing board must be flush with the back of the platform.
    * Participants may not jump from platform to platform.
    * Spot the participants as they walk across the boards if they look unstable at all.
    * Keep in mind that the boards sometimes kick out when a participant pushes off of them with a lot of force. Watch your shins!
    * Make sure there is always enough counter weight on the board before a participant steps on it. One person standing with both feet on the board is better than 2 people each with only 1 foot standing on the board.

## Nitro Crossing
* **Objective:** The group has to obtain the rope using any resource found within the group and cross the area bordered by the lines without touching the ground. At some point during the activity, a member of the group must carry some object (rock, log, or can of water) without dropping it or spilling it. Once across, participants can only spot –they cannot return to give any assistance. If someone touches the ground between the boundary lines or the object is dropped or water spilled, the whole group must return to the beginning and start over.
* **Description:** This is a rope suspended from a cable, between two trees with boundary lines drawn in the mulch creating an imaginary “pit” over which the participants must swing. The measurement from the rope to the platform is the same as the measurement from the rope to the start line.
* **Set Up:** N/A
* **Rules:** N/A
* **Safety:**
    * Prior to setting the task, encourage a ‘hang test’, asking each participant to hold their own weight on the rope for 5 seconds. This gives you and them some insight to their need for spotting and support.
    * Do not allow diving or jumping for the rope.
    * Each participant should be spotted as they swing across.
    * Instruct participants not to use extensive force to swing members across the no touch area.

## Spider’s Web
* **Objective:** To pass each member of the group through a separate web opening without letting any part of the body touch any part of the web. Once an opening has been used, that section is closed to further passage. If a participant on the opposite side of the web touches, that person has to return to the beginning side and the section that they went through remains closed. Participants cannot be passed over or under the web.
* **Description:** A prefabricated, bungee cord web strung between two trees 10-14 feet apart. The web should have between 14 and 18 openings.

    * If you have a participant that is too large to fit through any of the holes, either choose a different activity, or brief the activity allowing a certain number of touches before the group gets consequences.
    * Clothes pins can be appropriate to mark ‘used’ holes.
    * Lizard Puzzle can be used in conjunction with the web for a no lifting version.

## Team Triangle
* **Objective:** Participants begin the activity by standing on the platform. Without making contact with the ground, every member of the group attempts to traverse the triangle, touch each tree, and return to the platform again.
* **Description:** This element consists of 3 foot-cables forming a triangle. Each cable on this triangle is installed with quite a bit more slack than on other low elements. A 3-foot square platform is located in the middle of the triangle.
* **Set Up:** N/A
* **Rules:** N/A
* **Safety:**
    * Participants should be asked to step carefully over the foot cables as they move into the center of the triangle
    * Do not allow participants to jump from or onto the platform
    * Participants on the platform will be able to provide support and spotting to other group members. Additional spotters may be added as needed on the outside of the triangle.
    * Participants should be advised to step down if a fall is imminent. Diving or lunging toward a tree or support pole should not be allowed.
    * Contact with the ground can result in the individual starting the exercise over or can result in the entire group starting over. Make adjustments as appropriate to the individual or group.
    * When wet, this element may be more slippery than other low cable elements. This is because of the slack in the line, as there is an ‘uphill’ and ‘downhill’ when walking on the cable near the trees. Make participants aware of this, and spot as appropriate.
    * Participants should not interlock fingers while supporting people - mittens not gloves
* **Special Consideration:** N/A
* **Age:** Any
* **Number of People:** a typical group size for this element is 10-12 participants.

## Ultimate Team Triangle
* **Objective**: To traverse the foot cable. If desired, a person can circumnavigate the triangle, move from one platform to another, or two participants are going in both directions, and pass at some point along the way.
* **Description:** This consists of foot cables configured in a triangle between trees. There are hand lines down from the tree to assist the participant. There are also three small platforms in the center of the triangle.
* **Set Up:** N/A
* **Rules:** N/A
* **Safety:**
    * Each climber on a cable should have at least two spotters, one on either side of the cable. Additional spotters are often added, and should be used as necessary.
    * The most effective spotting position is a half-step back from the climber towards the starting point.
    * If a fall occurs, the hand-line will cause the climber to fall back towards the starting tree.
    * Instruct the climber to let go of the rope and step off when a fall is imminent. Holding on to the rope will make the climber fall to the ground and back towards the tree.

## The Up and Over Wall
* **Objective:** Using all of your group members, everyone must get up and over the wall, beginning on the front of the wall. After the first person gets to the platform, they may help two more people up and then they must climb down the ladder, creating a rotation at the top. Once down the ladder, you must return to the front of the wall for spotting only. The last person must get over with no assistance from the bottom of the wall. The sides of the wall and clothing may not be used to get over the wall.
* **Description:** A smooth surface, 12- foot wall, with a railed platform and ladder on the back.
* **Set Up:** N/A
* **Rules:** N/A
* **Safety:**
    * You should put the group in harnesses to give the participants something to grab on to besides body parts. (There is no belay at the wall)
    * Teach the group appropriate spotting for this activity
    * Spotters must be 180 degrees surrounding the person climbing
    * Continue spotting until the climber has their feet on the platform
    * When assisting people over the wall, remember the shoulder is in its weakest position when the arm is over the head. Be careful when pulling on arms.
    * Emphasize proper lifting techniques
    * Do not use belts, shoe laces, or articles of clothing as aids to get over the wall.
    * Teach the group how to “smear” (or to push toward the wall) to slow the descent, if a participant should fall and slide down the front of the wall.
    * When going over the wall remember:
        * Keep your fingers out of cracks
        * Keep your body close to the wall
        * Try to limit how much you kick your feet.
        * Don’t walk your feet up the wall
        * Communicate with your spotter
    * When assisting from the top remember:
        * Keep both feet on the platform
        * Your head should never be below your waist
        * No hanging people by their feet
        * Do not straddle the wall and hang one leg down to support a participant up
        * Allow the climber to assist you by using their hands
    * Generally, there should be no more than 3 people at the top of the wall with 1 person in transition
    * Spot the descent down the ladder from the back of the wall, as this is a place where injuries have occurred because people let down their guard. Instruct participants to climb all the way down to the ground rather than jumping down from partway.

## Whale Watch
* **Objective:** To challenge the group to use their weight to balance the platform so that the ends are not touching the ground. The group size is generally 12-15 participants.
* **Description:** The Whale Watch is a large wooden rectangular shaped platform which is balanced on a low beam. It is 6-8 feet wide.
* **Set Up:** N/A
* **Rules:** N/A
* **Safety:**
    * All participants and spotters should keep their hands and feet and body parts away from the area where the platform touches the ground and where the platform balances on the center beam.
    * Participants waiting to step onto the element should stand at least one foot away from the edge to avoid getting feet stuck under the platform.
    * Instruct participants to not to step off without telling the group. This could result in the platform falling quickly to the other side and surprising someone, and possibly causing a fall.
* **Special Consideration:** N/A
* **Age:** Any
* **Number of People:** 12-15 participants
* **Suited for Professional Programs:** Yes
* **Complexity:** 4
* **Themes:**
    * Leaders emerge and group members begin to take on specific roles within the team
    * Activity creates a heightened awareness of group strengths
    * Problem solving
* **Variations:**
    * Divide the group and have them stand on opposite ends. Ask them to step onto the platform and change ends without the platform touching the ground.
    * The group stands all the way around the periphery of the platform and attempts to make a 180 or 360 rotation without touching the ground.
    * Have one group member balance the platform. Continue to add 1 person at a time until the full group is up and the platform balanced.
    * Have the group gather at one narrow side of the platform resting on the ground. Elect a greeter from the group to welcome the group onto the platform. Instruct the group to climb aboard the grounded side of the S.S. Cornell. Instruct the group that the first task is to level the boat so that we can go out to sea without the platform touching the ground. A touch results in a restart - all off then all aboard again. Allow for brainstorming between attempts. The group shows that they have control of the boat by singing a round of “row, row, row your boat” once balanced. Congratulate them then instruct them that this is the new starting point and now that they have leveled the boat they are headed out to sea. Unfortunately, only people on the starboard side of the boat are seeing whales so they must now switch sides without capsizing the boat (touching the ground). An additional challenge: everyone must stay on board and level but no one's feet can touch the platform. You may elect to give the group “three gallons of water before capsize (three touches) or if the group is struggling and you want to see them succeed inform them that the ship's engineer has fixed the bilge pump and x number of gallons are allowed before capsize.

## Wild Woozy
* **Objective:** Two participants work together to traverse the element. Each person stands on a cable facing the other person. The pair begins on the narrow end of the V and attempts to move along the cable as far as possible by leaning into each other. Spotting is provided by the remaining members of the group.
* **Description:** Cables strung in a V shape starting from 1 tree and each cable ending at another tree.
* **Set Up:** N/A
* **Rules:** N/A
* **Safety:**
    * Participants on the cable must have 2 spotters each before stepping up, and these spotters stay with them the entire time they are on the cable
    * Spotters are also needed on the inside of the V. Start with 1 spotter near the beginning, with back straight and bent forward. (The back of the spotter is protecting the climbers from hitting the ground should they fall inside.). As the climbers get wider and wider apart, more spotters are added to the middle in the same position. By the end, climbers typically fall onto the backs of the in-side spotters.
    * Participants who may be prone to back pain should not be in the role of an inside spotter.
    * Ask participants to step off if a fall is imminent
    * No running on the cable
    * Participants should not interlock fingers when leaning on each other, and should be aware of undue strain on each other’s wrists - mittens not gloves
* **Special Consideration:** Most of the same safety concerns of the Low Woozy apply to the High Woozy (no interlocking fingers; both fall to the left; etc.), and it works well (though is not necessary) to do the elements in sequence. Participants fall in the middle, leaving the ropes in a problematic lead for the next ascent. There is a large loop of p-cord over each foot cable used to hoist rope up and over foot cable, thereby correcting the lead. **High Woozy requires a chest harness and proper rear clip in. Remember, a chest harness is always paired with a seat harness.**
* **Age:** Any
* **Number of People:** 8 or more. At least 6 spotters are needed for 2 climbers on the cable.
* **Suited for Professional Programs:** Yes
* **Complexity:** 4
* **Themes:**
    * Leaders emerge and group members begin to take on specific roles within the team
    * Activity creates a heightened awareness of group strengths
    * Problem solving

# HIGH ELEMENTS AT HOFFMAN COURSE

### Burma Bridge
* **Description:** *A.K.A Frankestein Walk* -> Participants will climb onto a series of platforms and make controlled jumps from one to the next. Each participant is securely attached to a front-clip harness, ensuring safety while they test their balance, bravery, and maybe their vertical leap.
* **Safety:** Follow SOP
* **Special Consideration:** Because this activity is the only traversing activity that is inclined, it is also the only traversing activity that requires the belayer to significantly take up slack as the participant navigates it.
* **Variations:** N/A
* **Group Element:** No
* **Team Belay:** No

### Catwalk
* **Description:** Participants climb and mount a horizontal telephone pole, choosing their own level of challenge. Common objectives include standing up on the pole, walking across it, swapping sides with another climber, balancing on one foot, attempting a (slightly wobbly) tree pose, or even engaging in a friendly pool-noodle duel. Each challenge encourages balance, trust, and a good sense of humor.
* **Safety:** Follow SOP
* **Special Consideration:** The log is big and hard and doesn’t move. It can hurt to fall on it. This element will be slippery on wet days, and clients should be reminded of this. The dismount is also important. There is more than one way to dismount safely, but participants should be instructed to self-spot.
* **Variations:** N/A
* **Group Element:** Yes - Pairs
* **Team Belay:** No

### Flying Squirrel
* **Description:** This element is a very unique element that does not require much physical exertion and is especially versatile in accommodating older persons, persons with disabilities, or especially fearful participants. Participants are clipped (front or back; back is very nice for this event) with a static rope that runs up to a pulley overhead, back down to a directional pulley, and then to the group. **The directional rig consists of a pulley and a steel carabiner attached to the eyebolt on the NE pole of the tower. This steel carabiner should be attached to the eyebolt only, not the eyebolt and back up cable combined. This second connection (eyebolt and backup cable) puts a ½ twist in the direction of the rope and carabiner. Be sure the rope is “clean” rather than crossed where it comes out of the pulley.**
<br> The number of participants needed to haul a participant will vary by group (and by participant!), but 8 is the norm. **At least three (for small children) and preferably more participants should be clipped in with butterfly loops.**
<br> While not physically challenging for the participant, the activity is empowering in that the participant has control over how fast and how far they are raised. Haulers should be instructed to be responsive to participants’ requests. Some instructors like to have a designated person in charge of communication calls. Participants should not be pulled up too quickly as there is a chance they could actually get flipped up and over the cable. Participants must also not be pulled up so far that the knot strikes the pulley. Communication calls are especially important on this event, both going up and coming down. Be careful of descending too quickly, especially at the end. It’s easier for the participant to land while swinging forward.
<br> *Be careful not to lose the end of the rope as it wants to run back up to the pulley if not secured, and the retrieval is a hassle!*
* **Safety:** N/A

### Lily Pads
* **Description:** With support from a team on the ground, the climber ascends to the starting platform and works with their team to navigate a series of suspended “lily pads.” The goal is to travel from the initial platform to the final lily pad—or all the way to the ending platform for an added challenge. Communication, problem-solving, and a bit of courage are key to making it across without feeling like a very tall frog.
* **Safety:** Follow SOP
* **Special Consideration:** N/A
* **Variations:** N/A
* **Group Element:** No
* **Team Belay:** Yes -> 3+

### Multi-Vine
* **Description:** The climber traverses a single suspended cable while using a series of hanging ropes for balance and support. It’s a steady walk that tests focus, coordination, and trust—kind of like tightrope walking, but with backup.
* **Safety:** Follow SOP
* **Special Consideration:** N/A
* **Variations:** N/A
* **Group Element:** No
* **Team Belay:** No

### Postman's Walk
* **Description:** Climbers ascend to the top of a telephone pole and attempt to traverse a single cable while using a second horizontal cable for hand support. The challenge is to stay balanced, trust the wire beneath them, and make their way across—essentially mastering the art of looking graceful while walking on what feels like a very ambitious clothesline.
* **Safety:** Follow SOP
* **Special Consideration:** N/A
* **Variations:** N/A
* **Group Element:** No
* **Team Belay:** No

### Quadrophenia
* **Description:** This element consists of a platform on top of a pole, with 4 outer poles making a square around the center. The outer poles have 4 separate belay cables and swaged cables at the base so that one may belay with either a steel (preferred) or aluminum screwgate locking carabiner and belay device.
<br> **Objective:** To get 2-4 people standing together on top of the center pole and then work together to perform various yurt-circle challenges.
* **Safety:**
    * Each climber is connected through a single carabiner clipped in the front belay loop.
    * Remove the ladder from the pole when all climbers are on the pole.
    * Climbers should release hands when the group starts to fall.
    * Instruct climbers to put hands and feet up as bumpers when they fall.
    * Coach participants to stay in line with their belay rope and belayer. Do not allow climbers to switch places on the platform so that ropes do not become tangled.
    * Climbers should avoid holding on to any belay ropes or carabiners.
* **Special Consideration:** N/A
* **Variations:**
    * Paired activities or an easier Leap of Faith
    * **Yurt Circle Activities:**
        * Group links hands and leans out together.
        * Group leans out, squats down, and stands back up together.
        * Link hands with the person opposite you and lean out. Then, try to sit/stand.
        * Link one hand with the person across from you and lean out with the other hand in the air. Then, try to get one foot off of the platform.
        * Have one person turn around and the rest of the group supporting them by either holding the back of their harness or holding their body as they lean out.
        * Bring a small circle of rope or webbing and lean out holding onto this. Try to pass the knot or sit/stand. \*If possible, drop the webbing before the group falls so that it does not get caught on anything.
        * Leap of Faith variation for a single large participant or for those who want a lower level of challenge that compares to a Leap of Faith. (No jumping off from the pole!)
        * Be creative and think of some more!
* **Group Element:** Yes -> 2-4
* **Team Belay:** Yes -> 8+

### Leap of Faith (climbing holds and trapeze) & Leap of Faith (buoy with bandanas)
* **Description:** This activity results in a dynamic dismount or fall for which we use friction devices called Just-Rite Descenders (short telephone poles with drilled holes). While not unsafe to do this activity with a front clip into a seat harness, back clips with chest harnesses are strongly preferred to minimize the possibility of participants flipping over upon diving. If participants reach back to use the rope to help them stand on top of the pole, it is very important they be instructed not to grab and pull themselves up on the rope. Doing so results in a big loop of slack which will run through and burn their hands if they peel off during the maneuver. Thread a pool noodle on the rope before tying the knot to avoid a rope burn if a participant tries to grab the rope. This is recommended for both poles.
<br> Participants should also be instructed to spot themselves from swinging back into the pole. Those with shoulder problems should be steered toward the pole with the “soft” target. Participants should also be discouraged from diving off poles simultaneously, as it increases the stress on the cables over time.
* **Safety:** See quadraphenia safety + follow SOP
* **Special Consideration:** N/A
* **Variations:** N/A
* **Group Element:** No
* **Team Belay:** Yes -> 3-5+

### Centipede
* **Description:** It is a series of vertically suspended four by fours with randomly placed staples, strung together creating a long, dangling pole that is supported by a horizontal cable for the belay gear. One person climbs the boards using the staples as points of contact for feet and hands.
<br> **Operating:** Climbers should rely on staples or climbing holds for support. There is some movement in the element where the four by fours are connected, so participants should be instructed to keep hands and fingers away from the hardware that connects each section. When the climber has completed the climb and is ready to be lowered, have another participant pull the bottom of the Centipede off to one side and lower the climber slowly.
<br> **Set Up:** The lowest section is removable and stored in the highs shed to prevent unauthorized access. The section should be connected to the element using a rapid link or steel carabiner.
* **Safety:** Follow SOP
* **Special Consideration:** N/A
* **Variations:** N/A
* **Group Element:** Yes -> Pairs
* **Team Belay:** Yes (can be solo belay as well)

### Climbing Wall
* **Description:** On the South side of the tower there are two climbing walls. These both lead into the tower and they are an efficient way to get groups into the tower to do the Zip Line. The climbing holds are prone to spinning and they get retightened as needed.
<br> Frequently participants will enter the tower from the climbing wall and start to unclip their belay carabiner before they are clipped into the tower. One way to avoid this is by letting them know that in the tower the facilitator is the only person who calls belay commands and clips/unclips participants.
* **Safety:** N/A
* **Special Consideration:** N/A
* **Variations:** N/A
* **Group Element:** No
* **Team Belay:** Yes (can be solo) -> 3

### Dangle Duo (Giant's Ladder)
* **Description:** This is a big duo and it is not easy—it is very physically challenging and often takes a pair 45 minutes or even an hour. It may be top- or bottom-belayed. Top belaying is less interesting as belayers can’t see climbers, although bottom-belaying the first climbers who can then top-belay their partners makes for a nice sequence of getting a group of 10 into the tower. The bottom rung of the duo is detachable for access prevention and lives in the shed.
* **Safety:** Follow SOP
* **Special Consideration:** N/A
* **Variations:** N/A
* **Group Element:** Yes -> Pair
* **Team Belay:** Yes (can be solo to) -> 3

---

### Vertical Playpen
* **Description:** The Playpen is set up for up to three climbers and like the Duo is very physically challenging, often taking 45 minutes or an hour.
<br> Most of the same issues mentioned above (for the Duo) also apply to the Playpen: spotting, tie-ins, following rope lead, etc. **Because carabiner clip-ins get rubbed up against the element, instructors are strongly encouraged to use 2 carabiners, or a direct figure-8 follow-through tie-in.** (The Playpen does not need to be fastened back after use.)
<br> **RAPPELLING**
<br> The tower is deliberately designed for rappelling—especially out the windows of the faced sides of the tower. Set-up is simple: Run a rope through one of the oversized rapid links or SRD’s above the window. The 100 ft ropes are just barely long enough—**Make sure both ends of the rope are on the ground.** Rappels may be tension-belayed (“fireman’s belay”) from below. Static ropes are preferred but dynamic may also be used. Rapping is one easy way for the last staff person to descend from the tower, although locking the tower this way is a little tricky.
* **Safety:** Follow SOP
* **Special Consideration:** N/A
* **Variations:** N/A
* **Group Element:** Yes -> Pair
* **Team Belay:** Yes (can be solo to) -> 3

### Zip Line
* **Description:** This is very fun and very long zip (400 ft), but is actually a smoother ride than most. The basic directions are very simple: Clip and Go. Instructors should be aware; however, that zips have been the occasion for many accidents and injuries on other courses, and the simplicity of the event should not mean approaching it with any less caution than other activities.
<br> **Launch:** We use an Adventure Experiences pulley (a double pulley), clipped by a locking steel or auto-locking carabiner to a single multiline lanyard, which is then clipped with an aluminum or steel carabiner into the participant’s harness. Getting the pulley and rapid link on the cable is a little challenging, requiring one to stand up on the staples below the cables. There is a chance of dropping the pulley so the area directly below must be cleared before set up. The carabiner or auto-lock must be screwed down and checked regularly. Participants must be fastened to Zip pulley with carabiner locked and “splash team” confirmed as ready. Tower tether must be unclipped before the participant launches. Front or back clips may be used, **but either way participants must launch from a sitting position** (with pulley already loaded). If a back clip is used, a chest harness should also be used. A chest harness is not required for a front clip in.
<br> **DISMOUNT:** This zip has a “gravity-break” and participants will come to rest at the lowest point of cable. A dismount or “splash team” receives the “zipper” with a step ladder (12 ft. fiberglass). Participant steps up on the ladder to release the load and then unclips. An instructor or participant then clips a haul line to the lanyard and returns it to the tower. (This requires a little practice.) Ladders must be spotted (participants are usually a little shaky). Others can assist in releasing load by tossing a retired rope over the cable and pulling down. The splash team need not include instructor, although instructors should help with first dismount and thoroughly brief others on their responsibilities before turning over the task to them, and continue to supervise the dismount process by checking in periodically. *It is the responsibility of the instructor in the tower to make sure the splash team is ready and the ladder removed before participant launch.*
* **Safety:** Follow SOP
* **Special Consideration:**
    * **Maximum participant weight 300lbs.** Pulley stays in the shed and should not be left in the tower. Potential issues with Zipline:
    * Launching before tether is removed (results in dangling participant).
    * Launching before the splash team is ready (especially consequential if the ladder has not been removed).
    * Running jumps or otherwise dynamic launches: releases load on pulley, possibly causing it to invert. Dynamic launches can also create a wave in the cable that can travel down to the pole and return, potentially flipping participant upwards.
    * Participants should **not** hold hands at any point on the descent- a high five can be attempted, but instruct participants not to hold each other. (In one isolated incident, 2 people held hands and the force twisted them around each other.)
    * There have been many incidents (at other courses) with hair and clothes (even pant legs) getting caught in a pulley. Our tether is long enough that this shouldn’t happen, but participants with very long hair should have it secured.
    * Many people want to take a “selfie” while they are zipping. Only devices that are attached to participants are allowed, like a camera with a strong strap, clipped to a harness. Encourage someone else to take a photo of the person while they zip.
* **Variations:** N/A
* **Group Element:** Yes -> Pair
* **Team Belay:** N/A

### Pirate's Crossing/ Heebie Jeebie
* **Description:** The “Pirate’s Crossing” is a classic challenge course element where participants cross a single foot cable between two platforms, using two slanted hand-ropes for support. It’s a balance-testing walk that appears on both high and low ropes courses, with difficulty adjusted by how loose—or mischievous—the hand-ropes are. A steady core and a touch of pirate courage go a long way.
* **Safety:** Follow SOP
* **Special Consideration:** The crossed ropes of this event are unique. **First, there is potential for the ropes to rub a carabiner’s screw-gate open; using 2 carabiners (opposite and opposed) or a direct 8-on-a-bight tie-in is strongly recommended**. Second, there is potential for a participant to get legs tangled in the ropes if they fall in the middle (the hard part). A tight belay is likely to help prevent excessive entanglement.
* **Variations:** N/A
* **Group Element:** No
* **Team Belay:** No

### Swinging Rings
* **Description:** The “Swinging Rings” challenge requires participants to navigate a series of suspended rings, using momentum to swing from one to the next. It’s a test of upper-body strength, coordination, and the ability to embrace a little controlled chaos in mid-air.
* **Safety:** Follow SOP
* **Special Consideration:** Because of the participant’s need to swing in an arc, it is necessary to allow more than an average amount of slack in this belay. The element is sufficiently high that “grounding” is not a major concern with a little extra slack. The participant does come off this activity with a fairly dynamic fall, for which belayers must be prepared and participants forewarned. Anchor persons for belayers are helpful and recommended.
* **Variations:** N/A
* **Group Element:** No
* **Team Belay:** No
